## Strapping Pins
The LED Mango includes a USB to UART adapter for plug and play programming and debugging. You will need to hold the boot button during a reset to enter the bootloader.

## Getting Started with the Arduino IDE
1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Add the ESP32 board support package to the Arduino IDE
3. Select `ESP32C3 Dev Module` as the board
4. Select the correct Port
5. Hold the Boot button during a power cycle to enter programming mode
6. Upload your sketch
